Answers to the First 20 Questions
findElement() vs. findElements():
findElement() returns a single WebElement. If the element is not found, it throws a NoSuchElementException.
findElements() returns a list of WebElements. If no elements are found, it returns an empty list.
Handling Alerts:
Use the Alert interface:
driver.switchTo().alert() to access the alert
alert.accept() to click "OK"
alert.dismiss() to click "Cancel"
alert.sendKeys("text") to enter text in an alert prompt
alert.getText() to get the alert message
Locating Elements:
ID, Name, ClassName, TagName, LinkText, PartialLinkText, XPath, CSS Selector
Preference varies, but CSS selectors are often preferred due to their speed, readability, and robustness compared to XPath.
Multiple iframes:
Use driver.switchTo().frame(index), driver.switchTo().frame(nameOrId), or driver.switchTo().frame(WebElement) to switch to a specific iframe.
Use driver.switchTo().defaultContent() to switch back to the main content of the page.
Keyboard and Mouse Events:
Use the Actions class:
Actions actions = new Actions(driver);
actions.moveToElement(element).click().perform(); (click)
actions.dragAndDrop(source, target).perform(); (drag and drop)
actions.contextClick(element).perform(); (right-click)
Screenshots:
TakesScreenshot ts = (TakesScreenshot) driver;
File source = ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
Useful for debugging, reporting errors, and documenting test results.
Select Class:
Used to interact with dropdown menus.
Select select = new Select(element);
select.selectByVisibleText("optionText");
select.selectByIndex(index);
select.selectByValue("value");
Dynamic Elements:
Use XPath axes (e.g., following-sibling, preceding, ancestor) to locate elements relative to more stable elements.
Use CSS selectors with partial matches (e.g., css=div[id*='partialId']).
Use explicit waits with expected conditions to wait for the element to become available or have specific attributes.
final, finally, finalize:
final: Makes a variable immutable, a method non-overridable, or a class non-inheritable.
finally: A block in a try-catch statement that always executes, used for cleanup (e.g., closing resources).
finalize: A method called by the garbage collector before an object is destroyed (rarely used).
String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer:
String: Immutable, each modification creates a new object.
StringBuilder: Mutable, efficient for single-threaded string manipulation.
StringBuffer: Mutable, thread-safe, slower than StringBuilder.
Access Modifiers:
public: Accessible from any class.
private: Accessible only within the same class.
protected: Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
Default (no modifier): Accessible within the same package.
Polymorphism:
Ability of an object to take on many forms.
In Selenium, you could have a WebDriver interface with implementations for different browsers (ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver), allowing you to use the same code to interact with different browsers.
this keyword:
Refers to the current object instance.
Used to disambiguate between instance variables and local variables with the same name.
Exception Handling:
try: Contains the code that might throw an exception.
catch: Handles specific exceptions.
finally: Executes code regardless of whether an exception occurs.
Prevents program crashes and allows for graceful error handling.
ArrayList vs. LinkedList:
ArrayList: Based on a dynamic array, efficient for random access.
LinkedList: Based on a doubly linked list, efficient for insertions and deletions.
Shallow Copy vs. Deep Copy:
Shallow copy: Copies object references, so changes to the copied object affect the original.
Deep copy: Creates a completely independent copy of the object and its internal objects.
Page Object Model (POM):
Design pattern where each web page is represented as a class.
Improves code reusability, maintainability, and readability by separating page elements and actions from test scripts.
Data-Driven Testing:
Reading test data from external sources (Excel, CSV, databases).
Allows you to run the same test with different inputs, increasing test coverage.
Design Patterns:
Singleton: Ensures that a class has only one instance.
Factory: Creates objects without specifying the exact class.
Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.
Scalable Tests:
Parameterization: Using variables to store test data or configuration settings.
Configuration files: Storing environment-specific settings (URLs, browser types).
Selenium Grid: Running tests on multiple machines and browsers simultaneously.
